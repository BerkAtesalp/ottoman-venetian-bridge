Summary:
This project explores the story of Anna Notaras Paleologhina (c.1420–1507), a Byzantine noblewoman who fled Constantinople after its fall in 1453 and settled in Venice. Her migration symbolizes the intersection of Byzantine, Ottoman, and Venetian cultures during a transformative period of Mediterranean history.

Context:
The research draws upon archival materials presented in the 2014 exhibition “Le Donne Benefattrici,” organized by the Archivio di Stato di Venezia and curated by Michela Dal Borgo and Alessandra Schiavon. The exhibition showcased original wills, letters, and notarial records of women who shaped Venice’s artistic, charitable, and intellectual life between the 15th and 18th centuries. Among them, Anna Notaras represents a unique link between the fall of Constantinople and the establishment of the Greek Orthodox community in Venice, including the foundation of San Giorgio dei Greci (1573).

Purpose:
Through a digital map and timeline visualization, the project highlights three symbolic moments:
1. 1453 – The fall of Constantinople under Ottoman rule.  
2. 1460 – Anna Notaras’s arrival in Venice and her patronage of the Greek community.  
3. 1573 – Completion of San Giorgio dei Greci, a symbol of Byzantine heritage in Venice.

The goal is to demonstrate how cultural resilience and migration created a living bridge between the Ottoman East and Renaissance Venice, preserving Byzantine memory within the heart of Western Europe.

## 🏛️ Project Overview

This digital micro-project explores the life and influence of **Anna Notaras Paleologhina (c.1420–1507)**,  
a Byzantine noblewoman who fled **Constantinople** after its fall in 1453 and settled in **Venice**.  

Her story represents a crucial cultural bridge between **Byzantine heritage**,  
**Ottoman expansion**, and **Renaissance Venice** — a meeting point of Eastern and Western worlds.  

The project visualizes this historical exchange through an **interactive Leaflet map** and  
a **timeline bar** showing three symbolic moments:
1. *1453 – The Fall of Constantinople*  
2. *1460 – Anna Notaras arrives in Venice*  
3. *1573 – Completion of San Giorgio dei Greci*

Each point illustrates how migration and cultural resilience contributed to Venice’s cosmopolitan identity.

## 🗺️ Digital Visualization

The visualization was created using a single HTML page (`map.html`) combining:
- **Leaflet.js** for interactive mapping.  
- A **custom-built mini timeline** bar for chronological navigation.  

Users can click on each year to navigate the map between Constantinople and Venice,  
showing the cultural journey of Anna Notaras and the continuity of Byzantine traditions in the West.

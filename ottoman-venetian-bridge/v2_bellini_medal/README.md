## 🕊️ Historical Context
After the **Ottoman–Venetian Peace Treaty (1479)** ended a 16-year conflict, artistic and diplomatic exchanges flourished.  
Bellini’s stay at the Ottoman court (1479–1481) led to the creation of portraits and medals depicting Mehmed II in the visual idiom of the Italian Renaissance.  
The medal’s obverse shows Mehmed’s imperial profile, while the reverse bears Bellini’s Latin inscription and **three crowns symbolizing Graecia, Asia, and Trebizond** — representing imperial legitimacy and cross-cultural synthesis.

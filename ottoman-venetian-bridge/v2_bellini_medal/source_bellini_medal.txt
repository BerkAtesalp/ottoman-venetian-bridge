Title: Sultan Mehmed II Medal (ca. 1480) — Cultural Diplomacy after the 1479 Ottoman–Venetian Peace
Author/Creator: Gentile Bellini (Venetian Gold Knight and Count Palatine)
Repository/Attribution: Istanbul Archaeological Museums (attributed examples in collections); associated with the Ottoman court under Mehmed II.

Summary:
This artifact documents the visual diplomacy that followed the 1479 Peace Treaty between the Ottoman Empire and the Republic of Venice. 
Gentile Bellini, invited to Constantinople by Sultan Mehmed II, produced court portraits and medals in an Italian Renaissance idiom. 
The obverse bears the imperial profile of Mehmed II; the reverse carries Bellini’s Latin signature (GENTILIS BELLINVS VENETVS EQVES AVRATVS COMES PALATINVS F.) 
and iconography of three crowns symbolizing dominion over 'Graecia, Asia, Trebizond'. 
The medal acts as a tangible “bridge” between Ottoman political imagery and Venetian humanist style.

Key Dates:
• 1479 — Ottoman–Venetian Peace Treaty concluded (end of the 1463–1479 war).
• 1479–1481 — Bellini’s sojourn at the Ottoman court in Constantinople (invited by Mehmed II).
• ca. 1480 — Struck/cast medal of Mehmed II with Bellini inscription (art-historical consensus places it around this date).
• 1481 — Mehmed II dies; Bellini returns to Venice.

Why it matters for the project:
The medal is a prime example of cultural diplomacy: a peace agreement enabling artist exchange, shared visual language, and durable symbols of political legitimacy.
It complements textual diplomatic records by showing how peace was represented and remembered materially.
